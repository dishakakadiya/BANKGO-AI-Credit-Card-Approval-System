BANKGO is a smart credit card approval system that uses AI to make fast and accurate decisions. 
It analyzes customer data like income, credit history, and spending habits to decide whether to approve or reject credit card applications.

# What I did:
Built a Machine Learning Model to predict if a customer is eligible for a credit card
Used tools like Python, Scikit_learn and Streamlit
Helped reduce manual work and made Approvala more Accurate
